## Creating a Pull Request
1. Always test the application to see if it works as intended with no additional bugs you may be adding!
2. State all the changes you made in the PR, not everyone will understand what you've done!

## Notes
If changing any of the opcode enums make sure to update the corresponding opcodes in the following areas:
- Website Client
- Website Server
- Unity Client
- Launcher Client
